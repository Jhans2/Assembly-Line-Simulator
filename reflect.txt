This assignment was the toughest one yet in the whole course. It takes me a very long time to understand the proper logic and concepts required. Although the first two milestones were 
less tough and the logic was somewhat clear on how to perform the requirements. But, milestone 3 was very time-consuming and it was very difficult for me to understand its logic and 
connect it to the previous milestones of the project. But, after a lot of debugging and try an error process, I was able to complete this long project.

This project taught me many concepts, some of which are STL containers and algorithms, There were many places where I have to implement a link-list algorithm using the container.
I also face many challenges where I have to use STL algorithms instead of basic loops, which we have learned so far. It took me a lot of practice to excel in implementing STL algorithms.

Moreover; I have learned how to handle files, like reading, opening, fetching the data from a file. Furthermore, I learned many advanced level topics designed for Advanced Object-Oriented
level programming like vectors, algorithms which are also the pillars of c++ programming.

Overall, I would like to thank my professor for teaching me so well, that I was able to complete every workshop, assignment on time, and understand each topic well.
